# 📊🔍 Search Queries Anomaly Detection using Python

## 📚 Introduction

This project focuses on detecting anomalies in search queries using Python. Our goal is to analyze search query data and identify outliers that deviate significantly from the norm. By detecting anomalies, we aim to uncover potential issues such as low user engagement, relevance problems, or data errors, informing optimization strategies for search engine performance.

Through data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning-based anomaly detection algorithms, we gain insights into query effectiveness, user behavior, and overall search experience enhancement.
